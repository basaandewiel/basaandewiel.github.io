title: Use Renode to simulate Arduino nano 33 BLE programmed with Zephyr
---
# About Renode
Renode is a development framework which accelerates IoT and embedded systems development by letting you simulate physical hardwaresystems  — including both the CPU, peripherals, sensors, environment and wired or wireless medium between nodes.

Renode promises to be able to simulate all kind of boards, like for example the Arduino nano 33 ble sense.
This means that developing software can become much easier, because you do not have to flash the software to be able to test it.

This sounds to me *very interesting*, not? So let's try it out.
* For the tests below I tried to simulate an Arduino nano 33 BLE. A rather popular device, of which I also have an hardware version.

But first we have to install Renode.


# Install Renode on Linux Mint 20.3
Source used: https://renode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/installing.html

`mkdir renode_portable`
* download portable release from https://github.com/renode/renode/releases/tag/v1.12.0 (you can also download an daily build)

`tar xf  renode-*.linux-portable.tar.gz -C renode_portable --strip-components=2` 

To use it from any location enter the created directory and add it to the system path:
```
cd renode_portable
export PATH="`pwd`:$PATH"
```

## Install dependencies
### Mono

```sudo apt install gnupg ca-certificates
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 3FA7E0328081BFF6A14DA29AA6A19B38D3D831EF
echo "deb https://download.mono-project.com/repo/ubuntu stable-focal main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mono-official-stable.list
sudo apt update
```

### Other dependencies
```
sudo apt-get install policykit-1 libgtk2.0-0 screen uml-utilities gtk-sharp2 libc6-dev gcc python3 python3-pip
```

# Using Renode
`cd <directory where you installed renode` 

Start Renode from command line

`./renode`

After some seconds a new window (renode monitor appears).
In this window you can give renode commands, like
```
mach create #create a machine
machine LoadPlatformDescription @platforms/boards/arduino_nano_33_ble.repl #load a predefined machine, of cours our arduino nano 33 ble
sysbus LoadELF @/home/<user>/zephyrproject/zephyr/build/zephyr/zephyr.elf #load an elf file you build for this target machine
showAnalyzer sysbus.uart0
logLevel -1 #very verbose
sysbus.cpu LogFunctionNames true #shows al kind of function names, so you can track what de simuated SOC is doing
s #start simulation of the machine
sysbus.cpu PC #read Program Counter
sysbus.cpu Reset #after this command program must be loaded again
```

You can save these Renode commands in a kind of script file, a file with extension .repl, placed in the script directory.
This is the `arduino.repl`  script I used for this hello world example.

```
mach create
machine LoadPlatformDescription @platforms/boards/arduino_nano_33_ble.repl 
sysbus LoadELF @/home/baswi/zephyrproject/zephyr/build/zephyr/zephyr.elf #load an elf file built for this target machine
showAnalyzer sysbus.uart0
logLevel -1 #very verbose
sysbus.cpu LogFunctionNames true
s #start simulation of the machine

```


## Hello world - built with Zephyr, running in Renode
I generated a "hello world" program in Zephyr. 

`west  build  -b arduino_nano_33_ble <...>/hello_world/`

NB: you have of course supply the correct path the the Zephyr program.

For instructions on how to install and use Zephyr, see one of my other blogs on https://basaandewiel.github.io/Zephyr_bluetooth_programming/

I used following simple Zephyr program:
```
#include <zephyr.h>
#include <sys/printk.h> 
#include <device.h>
#include <drivers/gpio.h>

void main(void)
{
	const struct device *dev;
	dev = device_get_binding("GPIO_0");
	//The parameter passed to this function, should be the "label" 
	//property of the device you want to work with. it is described here: 
	//https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/zephyr/guides/dts/howtos.html#get-a-struct-device-from-a-devicetree-node
	//By searching the devicetree file (.dts), you can see the label of the gpio0 is "GPIO_0"
	gpio_pin_configure(dev, 27, GPIO_OUTPUT); 

	while (1)
	{
		gpio_pin_toggle(dev, 27);
		k_sleep(K_SECONDS(1));
	}
}

```

Start Renode, and give the following commands:
```
mach create
machine LoadPlatformDescription @platforms/boards/arduino_nano_33_ble.repl 
sysbus LoadELF @/home/<user>/zephyrproject/zephyr/build/zephyr/zephyr.elf #load an elf file build for this target machine
showAnalyzer sysbus.uart0
logLevel -1 #very verbose
sysbus.cpu LogFunctionNames true
s #start simulation of the machine
```

In the log window we now see a lot of messages; there are also a number of warnings (which I do not understand completely yet). The most interesting part is:

``` 
19:58:59.8914 [NOISY] machine-1/nvic: Completed IRQ 14 active -> inactive.
19:59:02.2434 [NOISY] machine-0/rtc1: Interrupt set by CC0 interruptEnable=True compareSet=True compareEventEnable=True
19:59:02.2435 [NOISY] machine-0/nvic: External IRQ 33: True
19:59:02.2436 [NOISY] machine-0/nvic: Waking up from deep sleep<==============
19:59:02.2437 [INFO] machine-0/cpu: Entering function arch_cpu_idle+0x12 (guessed) at 0x108C2
..
19:59:02.2609 [NOISY] machine-0/gpio0: Setting pin 27 to False<===========
...
9:59:02.8022 [NOISY] machine-1/nvic: Waking up from deep sleep
...
9:59:02.8044 [NOISY] machine-1/gpio0: Setting pin 27 to False<============
```

As you can see the trace starts at 19:58:59. The the `k_sleep`  command starts; it should sleep for one second, but as you can see Renode sleeps for three seconds. You can also see that Zephyr puts the SOC into deep sleep during the `k_sleep` command. 
It appears that the sleep time in Renode is three time of what is should be. I don't know yet why. Fact is that when I double the sleep time in Zephyr also the wait time in Renode doubles.


## Connect Arduino IDE to Renode
You can even connect Renode to Arduino SDK, so you can "flash" from Arduino SDK to virtual machine in Renode

`sudo modprobe vhci_hcd`

You need to install `usbip`: 

```
apt-get install linux-tools-generic
#gives usbip not found for kernel 5.4.0-97
sudo apt install linux-tools-5.4.0-97-generic
sudo apt install linux-cloud-tools-5.4.0-97-generic

#You may also want to install one of the following packages to keep up to date:
sudo apt install linux-tools-generic
sudo apt install linux-cloud-tools-generic
```


In Renode:
```
(monitor) mach create
(machine-0) machine LoadPlatformDescription @platforms/boards/arduino_nano_33_ble.repl
#Start the USB/IP server in Renode and attach the loader to it:
(machine-0) emulation CreateUSBIPServer
(machine-0) host.usb CreateArduinoLoader sysbus.cpu 0x10000 0 "arduinoLoader"
```
NB: you should use 'normal' double quotes, otherwise you get an error.

(0x10000 in the case of Arduino Nano 33 BLE board), the port through which the bootloader is connected to the host.usb controller (should be changed if you have other devices already connected) and the name of the loader (arduinoLoader in this case)

In Renode:
```
arduinoLoader WaitForBinary 120 true #start the loader
```
Now a password is asked for running usbip as root.
NB: if you don't use a GUI (if you use for instance i3) then the authorization does NOT work. I had to use a GUI, like xfce).

NB: ubuntu has no default root password. To set this do:
$ sudo -i

Type your own password when prompted, and then you will see # prompt. Now you can set up the root user password by typing the following command:
`$passwd`

Now I can build an application in Arduino IDE and "flash" it to Renode.
This seams to work for an ELF file generated via Arduino IDE, but not when generated via Zephyr. So I use the method above using the `loadELF` command.
