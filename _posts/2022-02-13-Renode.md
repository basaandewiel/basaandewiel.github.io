title: Renode (simulate development boards)
---
Renode is a development framework which accelerates IoT and embedded systems development by letting you simulate physical hardwaresystems  — including both the CPU, peripherals, sensors, environment and wired or wireless medium between nodes.


Renode promises to be able to simulate all kind of boards, like for example the Arduino nano 33 ble sense.
This means that developing software can be much easing, because you do not have to flash the software to be able to test it.

# Install Renode on Linux Mint 20.3
source: https://renode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/installing.html

* mkdir renode_portable
* download portable release from https://github.com/renode/renode/releases/tag/v1.12.0
* tar xf  renode-*.linux-portable.tar.gz -C renode_portable --strip-components=1

To use it from any location enter the created directory and add it to the system path:

cd renode_portable
export PATH="`pwd`:$PATH"

## Install dependencies
### Mono
* sudo apt install gnupg ca-certificates
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 3FA7E0328081BFF6A14DA29AA6A19B38D3D831EF
echo "deb https://download.mono-project.com/repo/ubuntu stable-focal main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mono-official-stable.list
sudo apt update

### other dependencies
```
sudo apt-get install policykit-1 libgtk2.0-0 screen uml-utilities gtk-sharp2 libc6-dev gcc python3 python3-pip
```

# Using Renode
Start Renode from command line
```renode```
after some seconds a new window (renode monitor appears).
In this window you can give renode commands, like
* mach create #create a machine
* machine LoadPlatformDescription @platforms/boards/arduino_nano_33_ble.repl #load a predefined machine
* logLevel -1 gpio0
* logLevel 3 nvic
* sysbus LoadELF @/tmp/zephyr.elf #load an elf file build for this target machine
* showAnalyzer sysbus.uart0
* s #start simulation of the machine

when I compile Zephyr sample Hello world, even after removing the print statement, I still got warnings
* nvic: Unhandled write to offset 0xD98..0xDA0 
After installing usbip (see below) I don't get any warnings anymore, but also no output on uart0


Connect Renode to Arduino SDK, so you can flash from Arduino SDK to virtual machine in Renode
* sudo modprobe vhci_hcd
(monitor) mach create
(machine-0) machine LoadPlatformDescription @platforms/boards/arduino_nano_33_ble.repl
Start the USB/IP server in Renode and attach the loader to it:

(machine-0) emulation CreateUSBIPServer
(machine-0) host.usb CreateArduinoLoader sysbus.cpu 0x10000 0 "arduinoLoader"

(0x10000 in the case of Arduino Nano 33 BLE board), the port through which the bootloader is connected to the host.usb controller (should be changed if you have other devices already connected) and the name of the loader (arduinoLoader in this case)

* ) arduinoLoader WaitForBinary 120 true #start the loader
This needs the command usbip what is not available
* apt-get install linux-tools-generic
give usbip not found for kernel 5.4.0-97
* sudo apt install linux-tools-5.4.0-97-generic
    linux-cloud-tools-5.4.0-97-generic

  You may also want to install one of the following packages to keep up to date:
    linux-tools-generic
    linux-cloud-tools-generic

When running above commands again to run arduinoloader this gives:
* as regular user, it asks for root password (for usbip), but this command is not allowed to run as another uer
* when started renode as root, it gives runtime renode errors


maybe problems were caused byfact that ubuntu has no default root password. To set this do:
$ sudo -i

Type your own password when prompted, and then you will see # prompt. Now you can set up the root user password by typing the following command:
`$passwd`

This does not solve the problem.
It appeared that executing the following command directly in a terminal, also fails; maybe this is the problem.
* start renode
* include @scripts/c
omplex/arduino_nainclude @sc
ripts/complex/arduino_nano/n
rf52840_ardui
noIDE_integration.resc 
* in another terminal execute
    * sudo /usr/bin/usbip attach -r 127.0.0.1 -b 1-0
This gives `libusbip: error: udev_device_new_from_subsystem_sysname failed
usbip: error: open vhci_driver
 ` 

When I do this command first `sudo modprobe vhci-hcd`  then the usbip command succeeds, but I can still not flash images to renode
